# Gotcha game management system

The goal of this repo is to build a game management system.

This system will allow players to register for the game. 
It will then randomly select which player need to eliminate the other player.
When a player is eliminated he needs to login to the system and mark the eliminated player. The system will then select another player to be eliminated.

Verification of elimination will be done by uploading a photo of both players.
